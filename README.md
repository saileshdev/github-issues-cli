# Github Issues CLI

**Here is a command line executable to fetch issues from any github repo. Check it out! **

## Getting started

In particular, as a first debugging check I suggest getting the test suite to pass on your local machine.
Run mix test and ensure that the tests pass.

         git clone https://github.com/saileshdev/github-issues-cli.git 
         cd github-issues-cli
         mix deps.get
         mix escript.build
         ./issues <user-name> <project-name> no_of_issues_to_fetch
